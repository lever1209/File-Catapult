# File-Catapult
Allows you to create links to local files using http(s*) and ftp to send them to friends so they can be viewed or downloaded

imagine you have a file you want to share, so you will click and drag it onto the program window or executable (or terminal for those of you who are snazzy enough to use it) and you can then select options before hitting publish

### I would suggest you do not use this application if you

  * Dont like web exposed ips (use a proxy*\*)
  * Cannot open ports
  * Dont like java
  * Want a permenant solution for file hosting
  * Want a secure solution for file hosting
  * Reboot your system often

Instead you should use something like google drive or sshd (sftp and scp)

#### This project exists to allow me to be lazy with friends and it may or may not evolve, you are free to fork this project

# This project will be developed and used by me, a linux user, and i have no intentions of testing on windows or mac for now
if enough people request it or i get bored i might create extra bits to allow it to work on other systems

(bugs submitted through github will still get fixed though, within reason anyway)

#### Things that need mentioning

Documentation will follow a successful beta test

\* https is an option but you will need to provide your own certificate, if you choose this route i hope you will not send the private half over the internet

*\* i may create a proxy that will be disabled by default, but i would need help hosting the proxy
