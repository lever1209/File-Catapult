# File-Catapult
Allows you to create links to local files using http(s*) and ftp to send them to friends so they can be viewed or downloaded

### I would suggest you do not use this application if you
  * Dont like java
  
  * Want a permenant solution for file hosting
  
  * Want a secure solution for file hosting
  
  * Reboot your system often

Instead you should use something like google drive or sshd (sftp and scp)

### This project exists to allow me to be lazy with friends and it may or may not evolve, you are free to fork this project

\* https is an option but you will need to provide your own certificate, if you choose this route i hope you will not send the private half over the internet

# This project will be developed and used by me, a linux user, and i have no intentions of testing on windows or mac for now
if enough people request it or i get bored i might create extra bits to allow it to work on other systems

(bugs submitted through github will still get fixed though, within reason anyway)
